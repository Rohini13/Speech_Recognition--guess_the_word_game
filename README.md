# Speech_Recognition--guess_the_word_game
Speech_recognition sounds like something really cool and hard to build,
but trust me it's a very simple and fun thing to do!!

In this project I've used **_PyAudio and SpeechRecognition_** packages to build a simple game asks you to guess the word_chosen by it from a list of words. It takes voice inputs and converts it into texts
and if you guess the word within the limited number of tries, to win.

### Pretty cool huh!!

Follow through these steps to play this game called:

1. clone or download this repository.
2. Install SpeechRecognition and Pyaudio packages.
3. Run the guess_the_word.py file in the shell. 
4. Now proceed as the game says!!

### CHEERS.
